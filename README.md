# Etiqa Assestment

## Getting Started

Hello,World

#Please test in on actual device to avoid timezone conflict.

For this assestment, I have implemented several package : 

1) get 
2) syncfusion_flutter_datepicker
3) intl
4) flutter_countdown_timer

For the state management, I am using Get X because in my current company, we use this way and Im used to it atm. 
If there's any chance given, will surely try to learn and adapt new things.
